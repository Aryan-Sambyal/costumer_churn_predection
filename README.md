# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction (Machine Learning)

This project predicts whether a telecom customer is likely to churn using machine learning models in Python.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## ML Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

## Workflow
1. Loaded Telco Customer Churn dataset
2. Performed EDA and churn distribution analysis
3. Cleaned data (converted TotalCharges to numeric and removed nulls)
4. Encoded categorical features using LabelEncoder
5. Applied StandardScaler for feature scaling
6. Trained Logistic Regression and Random Forest models
7. Evaluated using Accuracy, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix
8. Extracted Feature Importance from Random Forest

## Output
- Model performance metrics
- Confusion matrix visualization
- Feature importance plot
